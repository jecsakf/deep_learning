# Deep learning

I made these projects for a university course on deep neural networks.  
In the Elso_hazi.ipynb project I was introduced to the Python language and the numpy package.  
In the Masodik_hazi.ipynb project, a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) type neural network is to be trained and evaluated on a regression and a classification task using the Keras library.  
In the third_hazi.ipynb project, the segmentation of a vehicle from images of a given vehicle type is to be learned using a convolutional mesh.
